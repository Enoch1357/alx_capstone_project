_PROJECT OVERVIEW_
In this project, I aim to produce a simple task manager app. It should help users manage larger projects in life by dividing them into smaller tasks with time and date stamps to mark their ideal completion time. Like setting milestones and hoping to catching up to them in time.


_FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY_
This task managing app, that I call Tasker, has very user-friendly features that should enable users to create new tasks or delete unwanted ones, view and also manage current tasks by editing task info and marking tasks as completed as well. Users can also search tasks by name and yet again filter tasks by date assigned to them equally.


_TECHNOLOGIES EMPLOYED_
Front End
-	Flask for prototype
-	HTML, CSS for Page Design
-	JavaScript for Interactivity

Back End
- Data Storage: implementing storage for task data by persisting them in the local  storage.
<!-- -	Python with Flask for managing HTTP requests to and responses from the server
-	MySQL and MySQLAlchemy for Database Management -->

_ROADMAP TO FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS_
This version of the application uses local storage and hence is only feasible for small-scale use. In the future however, I seek to incorporate the presence of a database to store data, and hopfully improve it as such to be feasible for large-scale or organizational use as well.
